        <h3>Exercises:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Write a Python program to read a text file and count the number of lines in the file.</li>
            <li>Write a Python program to write a list of random numbers to a file and then read the file to display the numbers.</li>
            <li>Create a Python program that takes a file name as input and prints the contents of the file. Handle the exception if the file does not exist.</li>
            <li>Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and divides them. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the division process.</li>
            <li>Write a Python program to copy the contents of one file to another file.</li>
            <li>Create a Python program that reads a file and calculates the average of the numbers in the file. Handle exceptions for file not found and division by zero.</li>
